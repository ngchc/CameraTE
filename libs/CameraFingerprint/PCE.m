% Peak-to-correlation energy obtained from correlation surface restricted to possible shifts due to cropping
% In this implementation of Peak-to-correlation energy PCE carries the sign of the peak (can be negative)
% Input:   
%    C               cross-correlation surface calculated by crosscorr.m
%    shift_range     maximum shift is from [0,0] to [shift_range]
%    squaresize      remove the peak neighborhood of size (squaresize x squaresize)
% Output: 
%    Out.PCE         peak-to-correlation energy (PCE)
%    Out.PeakLocation  location of the primary peak, [0 0] when correlated signals are not shifted to each other
%    Out.pvalue      probability of obtaining peakheight or higher (under Gaussian assumption)
%    Out.P_FA        probability of false alarm (increases with increasing range of admissible shifts (shift_range)   
%    Out0 contains results for the test under assumption of no cropping (equivalent to Out0 = PCE(C))
% Examples:
%  Measure correlation of Noise1 and Noise2 in terms of PCE:
%  [pce1,pce0] = PCE(crosscorr(Noise1,Noise2),size(Noise)-1);   % search all possible shifts
%  C = crosscorr(Noise1,Noise2); Out0 = PCE(C)      % Out0.PCE = Out.PCE and Out.P_FA = Out.pvalue when no shifts are considered

if nargin<2, shift_range = [0,0]; end           % default: no shifts (no cropping) considered
